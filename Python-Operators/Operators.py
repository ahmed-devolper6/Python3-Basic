'''
    Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
    In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values
'''

'''
Python divides the operators in the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
and many of them
'''
x = 10
y = 150 
'''
Arithmetic Operators:

    Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:
'''

print(x+y)
# 160 int number
print(x/y)
#0.06666666666666667 float number
print(x-y)
#-140 
print(x*y)
#1500
print(x%y)
#10
print(x**y)
#1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
print(x//y)
#0



'''
Python Assignment Operators
    Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:
'''
x = 5

print(x)
#5
w = 5
w +=3
print(w)
#8
w -=1
print(w)
# 7
